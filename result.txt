There were 478 successful paths
Approximately 95.6% of pages will eventually lead to Philosophy
Average path length: 12.7322175732
Path Length Distribution: {5: 1, 6: 4, 7: 5, 8: 19, 9: 86, 10: 50, 11: 44, 12: 47, 13: 40, 14: 26, 15: 31, 16: 37, 17: 30, 18: 29, 19: 12, 20: 12, 21: 3, 22: 2}

The distribution appears to be bimodal, with the first mode located approx at 9 and the second approx at 15/16

One way to greatly reduce the number of http requests necessary is to check to see if the current page has been visited
in another path. Given that the crawling behavior is purely deterministic, any path that overlaps with another will have
the same outcome as that other path. So, if path A reaches a page P that has been crawled in another path B, we need
only to add the path length from A-P to the path length from P-Philosophy (or, if B becomes a cycle/dead end, report
that A will as well). The upside is that we do save a large number or HTTP requests; as there are only about 8 pages
one link away from Philosophy, this technique will immediately reduce about 490 HTTP requests in that last step alone.
The downside is that we must track the path length to Philosophy for each of these intermediate pages. Since the average
path length is 12.7322175732, we must now store data for about an additional 5866 pages.
